This web application allows users to upload pictures of their pets and discover which celebrities their pets resemble the most. Users can upload pictures of their pets through the user-friendly interface. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to compare the features of user-uploaded pet images with features extracted from pictures of celebrities.The application displays the top celebrity look-alikes for the uploaded pet image along with a similarity score. Users can scroll or click through different celebrity look-alike suggestions. Technologies Used: Frontend=React;Backend=Node.js, Express, Python; Machine Learning Model= PyTorch/ResNet18, trained on a dataset of 18,000 pet & celebrity images.
