After retrieving and configuring all the advanced statistics from the Web Scraping app, the data was used to train a Machine Learning Model on AWS Amazon Sagemaker. The predictions of the Model are used against the corresponding Vegas Odds. Various thresholds are used to determine the optimal chances of the model being more accurate than Sportsbooks.",
